# Description

Write a recursive function called `SingleNumber`. Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

# Example Output

|               Input               | Output |
| :-------------------------------: | :----: |
|       SingleNumber([2,2,1])       |   1    |
|                                   |        |
|     SingleNumber([4,1,2,1,2])     |   4    |
|                                   |        |
| SingleNumber([1,1,3,5,3,4,2,4,2]) |   5    |

# How to use it

-   Download main.go and main_test.go
-   Save them in some folder
-   Run `go run main.go` \* To run test `go test`

## Why 0(n)?

This is just to obtain vizually how fast is the program, and is called Big O notation.
