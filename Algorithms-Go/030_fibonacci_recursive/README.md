# Description

Write a recursive function called `Fib` which accepts a number and returns the `nth` number in the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of whole numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... which starts with 1 and 1, and where every number thereafter is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers.

# Example Output

|  Input  | Output  |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| Fib(4)  |    3    |
|         |         |
| Fib(10) |   55    |
|         |         |
| Fib(28) | 317811  |
|         |         |
| Fib(35) | 9227465 |

# How to use it

-   Download main.go and main_test.go
-   Save them in some folder
-   Run `go run main.go` \* To run test `go test`

## Why 0(n)?

This is just to obtain vizually how fast is the program, and is called Big O notation.
