## Frecuency Counters

-   "This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frecuencies of values." Colt Steele.
-   "This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings." Colt Steele.
-   Examples.

## Multiple Pointers

-   "Creating pointers of values that correspond to an ondex or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition." Colt Steele.
-   "Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well." Colt Steele.
-   Examples.

## Sliding Window

-   "This pattern involves creating a `window` which can either be an array or number from one position to another." Colt Steele.
-   "Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and new window is created)." Colt Steele.
-   "Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc." Colt Steele.
-   Example.

## Recursion

-   "It is a process (in these cases functions) that calls itself." Colt Steele.
-   [Martin and The Dragon (History)](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~ree/c101-b2/dragonstory0.pdf)
-   Example.
    -   [Recursion Example](https://github.com/cjairm/go/tree/master/Algorithms-Go/007_factorial_number)

## Binary Search (Divide and Conquer)

-   "This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data." Colt Steele.
-   "This pattern can tremendously `decrease time complexity`." Colt Steele.
-   Example.
    -   [Search a number](https://github.com/cjairm/go/tree/master/Algorithms-Go/006_search_a_number)

## Sorting

-   "Sorting is a process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order." Colt Steele.

### Bubble Sort

-   "A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top." Colt Steele.
-   Example.
    -   [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/cjairm/go/tree/master/Algorithms-Go/009_bubble_sort)

### Selection Sort

-   "Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position." Colt Steele.
-   Example.
    -   [Selection Sort](https://github.com/cjairm/go/tree/master/Algorithms-Go/011_selection_sort)

### Insertion Sort

-   "Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted." Colt Steele.
-   Example.
    -   [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/cjairm/go/tree/master/Algorithms-Go/012_insertion_sort)

### Merge Sort

-   "There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n ) to O(n log n)." Colt Steele.
-   "It's a combination of two things - merging and sorting!" Colt Steele.
-   "Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted." Colt Steele.
-   "Works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array." Colt Steele.
-   Example.
    -   [Merge Sort](https://github.com/cjairm/go/tree/master/Algorithms-Go/014_merge_sort)
